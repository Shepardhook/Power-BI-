# üéØ Power BI Interview Dashboard ‚Äì End-to-End Sample Project

This repository showcases an end-to-end Power BI dashboard project used for interviews. It simulates a real-world analytics workflow‚Äîfrom data creation to transformation, DAX modeling, Python visuals, and machine learning integration.

## üì¶ Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Synthetic Data Creation** using DAX Studio
- üõ† **Data Transformation** with Power Query
- üìä **Custom Views** and calculated columns using DAX
- üìà **Python Heatmap Visualization** for exploratory data analysis
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Script** integrated within Power BI
- üîÅ **Repeatable Framework** for future use or extension

## üß† Python Heatmap

The `Scripts/heatmap_script.py` visualizes correlation between numerical features to aid feature selection and insights.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = dataset
corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
üß™ ML Integration
Sample ML script to perform clustering (or classification) using scikit-learn:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
model.fit(dataset[['feature1', 'feature2']])
dataset['cluster'] = model.labels_
